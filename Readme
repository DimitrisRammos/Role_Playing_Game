According to our implementation of the game, the heroes move thoughout the grid as a team and not independently.
The monsters that have died in a war, revive after the end of the war to be ready for the next war.
The heroes always fight against monsters of the same level.
In the header file "information.h" you can find a number of constant variables that remain unchanged throughout the game.
Also, the input is taken from 8 txt files, examples of which you can find in the folder "files".
These files are opened from the main function of the program.
The file formats are explained thoroughly below:
-armors.txt:
    name_of_armor price requires_level reduse_of_damage
-firespells.txt:
    name_of_firespell price level low_damage high_damage energy reduce_of_defense rounds
